##### Why is this required?
At least 1 in 10 people in India have been diagnosed with Diabetes. Early detection and diagnosis can drastically reduce its impact on a person, although the current medical infrastructure and inaccessibility to proper diagnostics has allowed Diabetes cases to grow more than they should’ve. Not only is diabetes life threatening if not treated at the right time, it is also a very expensive disease to manage. With regular insulin inputs and constant monitoring of a person’s health it not only has a profound physical, but also a psychological impact.
